# Final Self-Assessment of Data Structures and Algorithms

Your last task is to write a **final self-assessment** of what you know after this course.

* **Note: Final Self-assessments can be written in English or in Finnish**. If you write it in Finnish, translate the self-assessment template into Finnish, but keep the numbering of the headings the same.

Do a final self-assessment of your skills and goals in the field of data structures and algorithms **after the course**.
Rename this Markdown document in your repository and name it in the format *LastNameFirstName-FinalSelfAssessment.md*.  

> The most important thing is to be honest with yourself and strive for an objective assessment of your own skills. 
  Self-reflection helps you better understand your strengths and weaknesses and can be used as a learning tool.

Consider the following points in your final self-assessment:

1. Discuss the data structures and algorithms you have used, learned or developed in this course. 
   Describe how you know how to design algorithms, measure the effectiveness of algorithms or the ability to apply different data 
   structures and algorithms.

2. Give concrete examples of successes or challenges you have faced in learning data structures and algorithms.
   Describe how you know different data structures and algorithms and what kind of new programming experience you have after the course.

I had a lot of challenges in the understanding of the 4.4 due to my own inability to read the instructions correctly, so I did the exercise wrong 2 times. The real challenge came from 5.4 ran into problems with the remove_node thing. I was stuck there for 4 days until I gave up and asked chatgpt what I was doing wrong and it gave me the remove the person part from the command and it worked and I called it a day. After this course and cryptology I have understood that algorithms can be used for wide variety of things such as computational problem solving, structuring data, analysing data, cryptography and security. I have found new neat tricks about python and I have understood that it is so much more than a learning platform for newbies in coding.

3. Identify the topics and areas of programming where you feel the need for additional practice or understanding after the course. 
   Think about and document what you learned about data structures and algorithms in this course.
   Consider and document your future learning and improvement goals related to data structures and algorithms.
   Summarize your programming journey by highlighting the skills you acquired, including a general understanding of programming, skills in various data structures and algorithms, hands-on experience, or implementing a project that utilizes data structures and algorithms.

I need to learn much more to effectively know where to use certain codes and algorithms, so I can be more efficient. I don't consider data analytics as a part of my degree but this course will most certainly help me with advanced programming. I still think the school years as a whole have only been a minimal scratch of the surface of developing stuff and I don't feel confident in my skills but atleast I know more. AI is very usefull as companion that will explain to you what something does exactly, like unittest, stack and the different versions of stack.

## Self-Assessment Template 

In your answer, follow the following **Self-Assessment Template**.

## 1. Introduction

This is the final assessment to data structuress and algorithms course, where I will discuss the things I have learned during the course

## 2. Skills

My strenghts are that I will gather knowledge of the things I need to know and how I will implement it quite effectively. Biggest weakness I have is that if I think that a thing has to be done in a certain wrong way, I will not budge from that thought process for days and I get hard stuck because usually the way I want to do the thing is way more complicated if not impossible. 

## 3. Learning

the algorithms I have used are bubblesort, iterative search, fifo, fibonacci sequence. I have learned how they work through a lot of usage of google and chatgpt. Designing and algorithm is easy if you can modify an existing algorithm for your specific program. If I have to build it from the ground up, it would be next to impossible for me. It would require further learning to apply the algorithms to different types of algorithms to new sets of data or programs

## 4. Objectives

I want to be able to implement algorithms where needed faster and more efficient so I can try to skip the part where I try to implement things that are impossible or unnecessarily hard

## 5. Conclusion

The next step is to pass advanced programming module, something else, get a degree and a job and be on my own way.
