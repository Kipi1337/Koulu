## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this self-assessment is to discuss the data structures and algorithms that I have used or I am familiar with. Describing projects, courses and programming experience I have, overall marking down strengths and weaknesses.

## 2. Skills

In data structures and algorithms, my experience is quite limited but I have used algorithms for example in math but I don't know if it is relevant. I have programmed python, Java and C languages but my skills are not as good as I want them to be.

## 3. Learning

I have learned how to read and understand code. Algorithms are used to predict the future of stocks for example. Data structures are in the dark for now.

## 4. Objectives


My objective for this course is to understand more scenarios where data structures and algorithms are used. I hope I can understand better how I can utilize them in the future in work and other projects

## 5. Conclusion

Summarize the self-assessment and outline the next steps and your own goals.
In this self-assessment I discussed what kind of starting point I have and what I want to achieve with this course. I hope by working hard I can achieve the goals of understanding and utilizing the technology in the future.
