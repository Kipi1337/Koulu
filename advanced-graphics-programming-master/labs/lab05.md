## Texture transparency and blending

- Take the LAB5 project as a starting point
- Load the 2 textures (terrain.jpg and grass.png) provided in LAB5 project
- Build a scene with one terrain quad and several hundred quads with grass texture
- Use Geometry::GenQuad to generate necessary geometry
- Modify the fragment shader in a way that output color alpha channel comes from texture and is unaffected by the lighting
- Modify the fragment shader that fully transparent pixels are discarded
- Make the grass 'swing'. The reference video uses shear matrix to achieve the effect. Similar effect can be achieved by rotating around z-axis
