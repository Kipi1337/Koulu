# Graphics Programming

&nbsp;
## **Introduction**
Welcome to the Graphics Programming course. Goal is to learn how to program modern graphics accelerators using OpenGL programmable pipeline.

- Low level overview of the graphics programming
    - Hardware accelerated 3D graphics architecture
    - Double buffering, page flipping, pixel formats, depth and stencil buffers
- Understanding of how 3D geometry is constructed from vertices
- 3D transformations using vectors and matrices
- Scenegraph model
- Lighting models (gouraud, phong, blinn)
- Texturing, multitexturing and blending
- Advanced topics
    - Mapping techniques, Shadow mapping, Normal mapping, Cube mapping
    - GPU Instancing
    - Stencil testing

&nbsp;
## **Learning outcomes**
- Hardware accelerated graphics architecture
- Concepts of graphics application design and structure
- Ability to understand and write shaders programs
- Strenghten programming skills


&nbsp;
## **Tools and technologies**
- On windows, use Microsoft Visual Studio
    - the free Community edition works just fine
    - Install support for C++ Desktop development
- All examples also contain makefile for Linux environment
- Git Bash
    - Install with default settings

- OpenGL / OpenGL ES
- C++ and Visual Studio
- glm (open source library)
- stb (open source library)

- Course contents is applicable to
    - Desktop PCs (Windows/Linux)
    - Mobile devices (Android, iOS)

&nbsp;
## **Prerequirements**
- Basics in programming
