# Graphics Programming

&nbsp;
## **The Core**
We use a 'minimum dependency' game engine *core* as a template for our graphics programming. This core engine is created during Game Engine Programming course, but we get to use it already.

Download and extract the *core* engine source files.
[Core Engine Source Files](../source/core/core.zip)

Download and extract the lesson01 zipped project to same folder with *core* source files.
[Lesson01 project](../source/lesson01/lesson01-start.zip)

After unzipping both files, verify that your folder structure looks similar to this:

- graphics-programming
    - core
        - glm-master
        - include
        - src
    - lesson01-start
        - lesson01.sln
        - Makefile
        - ... couple other project files ...
        - main.cpp
        - TheApp.cpp
        - TheApp.h


Lets get familiar with *core* engine

## **Happy Coding!**
