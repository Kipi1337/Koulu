# Deep Learning - assignments

* Autumn 2025 implementation 
* TTC8060-3011

In this GitLab Repository, you can find the templates of the Deep Learning assignments as **Jupyter Notebook** files.

### Student's name or Students' names

**INSERT THE NAMES OF THE ALL GROUP MEMBERS HERE!**. So add *student's name or students' names and student email addresses at JAMK*.

```
# Enter your information here!
student_name = 'Juuso Leppänen' 
student_email = "AD1885@student.jamk.fi"
```

Fork the repository for yourself to complete assignments in this course.

Note! Remember to make the repository **Private** immediately and give **Developer rights** to _Juha_. 

You can do all the course assignments 

1. alone or 
2. with another student in a group of two (pair work).

Assignments and assignment templates can be found in this GitLab repository.

* the assignments are forked for you so you can start doing them. 

Note! Keep the README up to date and, if necessary, link the new files that you have renamed in the course assignments.

### Assignment monitoring

Keep a record of the assignments you complete. Remember always to update **Assignment monitoring** file when you update your new assignments to the repository.
    
* [Assignment monitoring](points.md)

### Repository Forking

1. **Fork** the assignment repository for yourself
2. Change the repository permissions. Always create a **Private** repository, because the solutions to the assignments should not be visible to other students. If your repository is not private, the course is rejected.
3. Set the repository access rights to only yourself, your possible group work student and the course teacher (**Developer** rights) when you are starting to do the assignments.
4. Change the student's name to the forked repository before starting to do assignments.


## Return of Assignments

Implement all assignment answers directly into Jupyter Notebook or Markdown documents. Do not use formats like
Word or PDF. And also run all Notebook files before returning them to the repository. 
It is worth checking the repository to make sure that the **output fields** are visible. 
A Jupyter Notebook document should always be run from start to finish in one go.

* Always run Notebook documents before updating to the repository 
* Always check that the _Output_ cells are visible also in the repository.
* Check that the counter in the Notebook starts at one and increases by one, and there are no errors in the _Output_ fields of the result document.
