# Assignment Monitoring for Deep Learning Assignment 

You should monitor the progress of the assignments yourself by marking them as done and also approximate the points for the individual assignments.
* If the assignment has been successfully completed, mark an `X`.
* If the assignment has partly completed, mark the number of points you have approximated.
* otherwise mark `-` if not done. 
* Note! The final score is always calculated by the teacher, but it is the student's responsibility to mark the assignments they have completed.

In this course you approximate the points you earn yourself. The final score is calculated by the teacher. The **total** field contains your own estimate of the total points for the assignments.

after the second assignment set over on assigment 3 and 4 I started spending so much more time trying to learn everything at the same time which made the exercises probably pretty chaotic

| Assignment | 3.1 (2p) | 3.2 (4p) | 3.3 (4p) | total (10p) |
|:-----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
