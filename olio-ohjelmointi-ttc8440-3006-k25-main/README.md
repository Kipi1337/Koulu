# Learning Diary

## Course Introduction

### What do you hope to learn during the course?
During the course, I hope to strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and learn how to apply them effectively in C#. I aim to gain practical skills in building structured, maintainable, and scalable software using modern programming techniques. I also look forward to improving my familiarity with development environments and version control systems like GitLab. 

### What things would you highlight in modern web development?
In modern web development, I would highlight the importance of modularity, reusability, and scalability. Frameworks and libraries that support component-based architectures, strong integration with APIs, cloud services, and responsive design are key elements. Also, the ability to ensure security, maintain performance, and create a good user experience across various devices is essential.

### How much experience do you have in modern web development?
I have some basic experience with modern web development. I am familiar with general programming concepts and have some prior experience in Python. However, I am relatively new to working with C# and building larger, structured applications, especially with a strong focus on OOP principles and design patterns.

### What kind of goals do you set for yourself?
My goals are to:

    Deepen my theoretical understanding of object-oriented programming.

    Apply these concepts practically in C# projects.

    Become comfortable with using version control systems like GitLab in project work.

    Improve my ability to design and implement clean, maintainable code.

    Build a solid foundation for further learning in software development and related technologies.

## Module 1

### What have I learned?
In Module 1, I learned about the basics of object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, methods, and attributes. I also learned about inheritance and encapsulation, and how they support building well-structured and secure applications.

### What was new? Was something challenging?
Although I had some previous knowledge of object-oriented concepts, using them systematically in a more complex environment was new. Setting up the development environment and learning to use GitLab for project management was also a new and slightly challenging experience at first.

### What key concepts or technologies you found?
    Object-oriented programming (OOP) fundamentals

    Classes, objects, methods, and attributes

    Inheritance and encapsulation

    Setting up a development environment

    Using GitLab for version control and project management

## Module 2

### What have I learned?
In Module 2, I deepened my understanding of encapsulation, polymorphism, and dynamic object handling. I learned how these concepts contribute to creating flexible and maintainable programs.

### What was new? Was something challenging?
Polymorphism and composition were somewhat new topics. Understanding how polymorphism allows treating different objects uniformly and how composition can create complex behaviors from simpler parts required some practice but became clearer with hands-on exercises.

### What key concepts or technologies you found?
    Encapsulation for data protection

    Polymorphism for flexible object handling

    Composition for building complex behaviors

    Iterable objects and dynamic handling of objects

## Module 3

### What have I learned?
In Module 3, I learned about the C# programming language more deeply and explored how it differs from languages like Python. I studied classes, objects, properties, inheritance, static members, polymorphism, interfaces, composition, iterability, and dependency management in C#.

### What was new? Was something challenging?
Transitioning from Python to C# was initially challenging due to stricter typing and syntax differences. However, the strong structure and clear rules in C# also made it easier to manage larger projects once I got more familiar with the language.

### What key concepts or technologies you found?
    C# classes, objects, and properties

    Inheritance and static attributes in C#

    Polymorphism and interfaces

    Composition and iterability

    Dependency management in object-oriented programming
